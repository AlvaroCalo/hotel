# Hotel WebApp

This project is a dummy website I made for a course I attended.
It is a web application to manage hotel reservations. 
The hotel is called Hilbert inspired by the reservations system. 
The client can log in, make reservations and change his data.
The admin can view all the clients and all the reservations and make changes on them.

# Technologies

For the Front-End I've used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

For the Back-End I've used:
1. PHP 
2. MariaDB

# How to test it

You have to create a database called hotel and import the hotel.sql file. If you want you can change the name of the database in the conexion.php file inside phpfiles folder.

Thank you
